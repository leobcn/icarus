Icarus is a Go reimagining of [Sisyphus](https://github.com/lethain/sisyphus),
which was my second personal blogging platform, inspired by the many, many
mistakes I made in my first generation "Lifeflow" blog and also by ideas
around real-time analytics and content suggestions/ranking that came from
working at Digg.

For the third generation, looking to explore some additional ideas:

1. Be faster than 60ms to load the front page. Haven't profiled this in
    a very long time, but I'd guess Redis lookups are
    responsible for most of that delay (~85 Redis lookups for the
    frontpage to load). So... let's try to hit ~5 ms, which probably means
    keeping everything in-memory (and also updating analytics out-of-band,
    which will be easy in Go). We can use Redis Pub-Sub to invalid the cache
    if we're running with more than one instance.
1. Disqus comments are mostly just ads for me, and should either be removed
    entirely or replaced with something better / different.
2. Try to hack together an in-memory or Redis-backed solution for my very
    simple search needs. [Whoosh](http://whoosh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
    worked surprisingly well for the last one, but would prefer to reduce
    dependencies (or at least something more common like Sphinx).
1. Use [rrssb](https://github.com/kni-labs/rrssb) for better, simpler
    sharing to social sites.
2. ??

Keep doing:

1. Use Bootstrap, maybe [Bootstrap 4](http://blog.getbootstrap.com/2015/08/19/bootstrap-4-alpha/).
2. Use Redis for persistence.
3. ...

Also in terms of system administration and deployment, a few changes
in how I'm intending to deploy (although, you can do whatever you want,
I suppose):

1. The last version is running on Apache2 and mod_python,
    and then also fronted by Nginx for static assets and
    terminating connections. Let's just do Nginx fronting
    the Go server.
2. Get a [let's encrypt SSL/TKS cert](https://www.nginx.com/blog/free-certificates-lets-encrypt-and-nginx/)
    and then also enable [http2](https://www.nginx.com/blog/nginx-1-9-5/)
    both at the Nginx layer and the Go layer.
3. Give [SaltStack](https://saltstack.com/) a go for setup and deployment.


## Installation

First, you need to install [Glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide),
on OSX that might look like:

    brew install glide

Then you need to install further dependencies via Glide:

    glide install
