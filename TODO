OK, here is some stuff we need to do:

1. use a redis client pool instead of initializing them everywhere
1. at the bottom of each article should show the next and previous several articles
1. add right-rail
1. implement search ;-)
1. add social sharing links via https://github.com/kni-labs/rrssb
1. implement sorted sets for tags, popular, etc
1. implement analytics
1. add popular list page
1. add recent list page
1. add related articles list page
1. add overall analytics page
1. fix right-rail
1. before rendering markdown, strip out [TOC] (and preceeding
    HR if there is a following HR), since no longer have any
    support for that...
1. figure out code highlighting, both for rendering the already
    rendered pygments stuff, but also for rendering new articles
    with code
1. figure out something to do with comments, maybe just giving up on
    them entirely
1. print stylings for easy printing
