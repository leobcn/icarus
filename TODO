OK, here is some stuff we need to do.

Tomorrow:

1. implement search via http://www.blevesearch.com/
1. Analytics
    1. add ip rate-limiting logic to all analytics
    1. start tracking analytics
    1. add analytics to right-rail
    1. add /analytics/ page
    2. redis docs: http://redis.io/commands/
1. flesh out the footer to include various used technologies, etc

Friday?

1. before rendering markdown, strip out [TOC] (and preceeding
    HR if there is a following HR), since no longer have any
    support for that...
1. figure out code highlighting, both for rendering the already
    rendered pygments stuff, but also for rendering new articles
    with code
1. Take a look at:
    1. https://github.com/cespare/pastedown/commit/b6a75633f940eefcf91005b00cd57f7cf70dde77
    2. https://github.com/cespare/blackfriday/commit/5e95b16fff240cd1b2ae69578de7885db3901a60

Deployment

1. probably move from flags to json config for configuration
    (just too many flags for CLI IMHO)
1. saltstack for setting this all up
1. add css compaction/compression/merging
