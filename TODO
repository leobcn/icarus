    2. add list of tags page
1. cosmetic / UI
    1. add social sharing links via https://github.com/kni-labs/rrssb
1. Related pages
    1. calculate related pages for a given page
    2. create 'similar/related' right-rail module for each page
1. Analytics
    1. add ip rate-limiting logic to all analytics
    1. start tracking analytics
    1. add analytics to right-rail
    1. add /analytics/ page
1. implement search ;-)
1. use a redis client pool instead of initializing them everywhere
1. before rendering markdown, strip out [TOC] (and preceeding
    HR if there is a following HR), since no longer have any
    support for that...
1. figure out code highlighting, both for rendering the already
    rendered pygments stuff, but also for rendering new articles
    with code
1. figure out something to do with comments, maybe just giving up on
    them entirely
1. add css compaction/compression/merging
