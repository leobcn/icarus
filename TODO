OK, here is some stuff we need to do:

1. Analytics
    1. add ip rate-limiting logic to all analytics
    1. start tracking analytics
    1. add analytics to right-rail
    1. add /analytics/ page
1. RSS - use https://github.com/gorilla/feeds    
1. before rendering markdown, strip out [TOC] (and preceeding
    HR if there is a following HR), since no longer have any
    support for that...
1. figure out code highlighting, both for rendering the already
    rendered pygments stuff, but also for rendering new articles
    with code
1. implement search ;-)
1. add css compaction/compression/merging
