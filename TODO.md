OK, here is some stuff we need to do.

1. before rendering markdown, strip out [TOC] (and preceeding
    HR if there is a following HR), since no longer have any
    support for that...
1. figure out code highlighting, both for rendering the already
    rendered pygments stuff, but also for rendering new articles
    with code
1. Take a look at:
    1. https://github.com/cespare/pastedown/commit/b6a75633f940eefcf91005b00cd57f7cf70dde77
    2. https://github.com/cespare/blackfriday/commit/5e95b16fff240cd1b2ae69578de7885db3901a60

Deployment

1. saltstack for setting this all up
1. add css compaction/compression/merging


Issues:

1. search results return max 10... need to dig into
    http://www.blevesearch.com/ a bit more
2. add unindex support for search for removing pages
